#Tesla Stock Price Prediction using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) Overview
This project implements a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) using PyTorch to predict Tesla's closing stock price based on historical data and engineered features. The model explores various hyperparameters and evaluates the performance of different configurations.

Objectives
The assignment required us to:

Build, train, and evaluate an RNN using PyTorch.
Use a minimum of two hidden layers in the RNN architecture.
Experiment with at least three different sets of hyperparameters (e.g., number of layers/neurons, activation functions, epochs, learning rates, etc.).
Include the following steps in the implementation:
Feature Selection
Feature Engineering (if necessary)
Standard ML Preprocessing
Train-Test Split
Defining an RNN Architecture
Creating a Training Loop
Training the Model
Experimenting with Hyperparameters
Evaluating the Model
